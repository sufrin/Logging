## Logging

This library provides a simple way of (conditionally) invoking
logging messages. See the documentation for `org.sufrin.logging`.

## SourceLocation

This library provides two macros that yield the exact location
in code of the position at which they are invoked. See the
documentation for `org.sufrin.SourceLocation`.
